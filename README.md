# IntelligentDataMining

Machine Learning and Data Mining are very closely related. Therefore, I am dedicating this repository to bring them both together on Java platform. Please read the structure first in order to properly understand and use the code.

Classification falls under supervised learning. So it first needs to be trained, and hence each classification program I commit will have a commented code that depicts the training data. This data has already been created, executed and serialized in a ".ser" file. I will upload the file for you to readily use. In case you want to change the training data from scratch you can uncomment the commented part and do so. If you need my help in the matter, feel free to ask.

On the other hand, clustering is unsupervised. Therefore, every data point you feed to the algorithm, will be allocated to proper cluster. Everytime this happens, the ".ser" file will be updated, thus allowing the program to learn from history everytime it runs.
